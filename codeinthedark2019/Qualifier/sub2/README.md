# **The Competition**

Code in the Dark is a thrilling competition where you'll get the chance to put your mad HTML and CSS skills to the ultimate test, by battling fellow frontend hackers in two 15-minute rounds for a place in the grand finale and, once there, to win.

On stage, all you'll have access to is a specially crafted text editor on which you must stay at all times. By no means you are allowed to leave this editor. You are also not allowed to use any measuring tools, nor any other thing besides your fingers to take measurements on the screen.

**Browser previews are off limits. This means you won't see the end result until the timer reaches its end.**
